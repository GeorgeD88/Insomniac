# Insomniac
**Insomniac** is a Discord bot that's been in the works for over 2.5 years! This bot wasn't made with the intention of publishing it, it's just a project that allows me to work with and master the very fun-to-use Discord API. <img align="right" src="https://github.com/GeorgeD88/Insomniac/blob/main/insomniac_avatar.png" alt="Bot Avatar" width="200" height="200"> The Bot has many many random commands, spread across many cogs. The main bot program is very thoroughly developed and ensures that every edge case is covered. Feel free to fork this repository at your own leisure whether you want to just look around the repo or even use as the foundation for your own bot! Currently I have the bot running 24/7 on my Linux server and people of the UCF 2024 discord server use it daily.
